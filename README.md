## 🧠 How It Works

- Tasks are scored by **value ÷ time**, so high‑impact, quick tasks rise to the top.
- Periodic tasks are managed in a **separate table**, keeping routines organized apart from one‑off tasks.
- Flow Mode lets you tackle tasks one by one, scheduling ahead or skipping unwanted items.
- The calendar view allows you to **manually schedule your day** based on priority.
